# Short-sort
<b> Deletes Video Files from Local Storage, and lets you scroll through them. </b>
Depending on how many videos there are first load might take a few seconds.

1. Before you run it edit Short-Sort.py (text-editor) and add your folder path in line 11 "VIDEO_FOLDER = " (videos in subfolders will be included)
2. Start Short-Sort.py
3. Open your WebBrowser and go to 127.0.0.1:5000 or localhost:5000


<b> Controls: </b>
How it's meant to be used: 
Put your right hand on the arrow keys, down = next, 0 (num-pad) skip forward in playing video, if you want to delete one that is currently playing just press right arrow twice. Warning! Once Deleted there is no coming back, don't go too fast just because you are bored lol

1. [Keyboard ArrowDown] or [MousWheel Down] is NextVideo
2. [Keyboard ArrowUp] or [MouseWheel Up] is PreviousVideo
3. [NumPad 0] Forwards the playing video by 10%

4. [Keyboard ArrowRight] once is "Mark for Deletion"
5. [Keyboard ArrowRigh]t again and the video will be deleted from your drive

6. [Keyboard ArrowLeft] will cancel the "You sure you want to delete?" window

Info: This version does not include .mkv files. Transcoding/ffmpeg was removed too for simplicity.
